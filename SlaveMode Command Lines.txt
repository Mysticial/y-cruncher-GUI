Everything here is subject to change.

This will eventually be added to y-cruncher's "Command Lines.txt" file once the
feature is complete and stable enough for use.

Note that none of this is available in y-cruncher v0.7.5. It currently only
exists in the development builds.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slave Mode:

    {program} slave:{version}
              [-port:{port}]
              [-ctype:{type}]
              [-allowremote:{value}]
              [-printtraffic:{value}]

    y-cruncher slave:0 -port:20000
    y-cruncher slave:0 -port:40000 -ctype:json -allowremote:1 -printtraffic:1

Runs y-cruncher in "Slave Mode" which allows it to be controlled over TCP.
This command is not meant to be directly used by the user. It is meant for 3rd
party applications (such as a GUI) to interface with y-cruncher.

    Parameter: slave:{version}
    Examples:  slave:0

    "slave:0" is currently the only valid value. The number is a version number in
    anticipation of future changes that are backwards incompatible.

--------------------

    Parameter: [-port:{port}]
    Examples:  -port:20000, -port:30000

    This specifies which port y-cruncher should listen on for incoming connections.
    If the option is not specified, it uses port 30000 by default.

--------------------

    Parameter: [-ctype:{type}]
    Examples:  -ctype:json, -ctype:acfg

    Valid Values: json, acfg

    Specifies the object format to be used for all communication.
      - "json" is standard JSON.
      - "acfg" is y-cruncher's custom format that it uses for its configuration files.

    Both formats use UTF-8 without BOM. However, y-cruncher's JSON implementation
    is not complete as it lacks floating-point and unicode escape characters.

    If this option is not specified, it uses JSON by default.

--------------------

    Parameter: [-allowremote:{value}]
    Examples:  -allowremote:0, -allowremote:1

    Valid Values: 0, 1

    Should y-cruncher allow connections that are not from localhost?
        0   only allows connections from localhost.
        1   allows all connections from any host.

    y-cruncher has the ability to overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem.
    Furthermore, if y-cruncher is running as administrator (for swap mode), it also
    has the ability to expose the contents of deleted files on the filesystem.

    This is a major security issue if an attacker manages to connect to and hijack
    a y-cruncher session running in Slave Mode.

    If this option is omitted, the default is to disallow remote connections.

    Slave Mode was originally intended to allow a GUI to be built on top of
    y-cruncher. It was never intended as a remote-control device.

    If security really matters, you should not rely solely on this option to
    block external connections. y-cruncher is not hardened against exploits
    as it was only ever meant to run as a stand-alone desktop application.

--------------------

    Parameter: [-printtraffic:{value}]
    Examples:  -printtraffic:0, -printtraffic:1

    Valid Values: 0, 1 (default 0)

    When set to 1, y-cruncher will print all TCP traffic that it sends and
    receives. This is for debugging purposes.
