# Test GUI

This is a work-in-progress test GUI for building and testing y-cruncher's Slave Mode protocol.
This is not intended to be the final - let alone usable GUI.

This is a JavaFX program with an Eclipse project.

To run, have a y-cruncher binary in the current working directoy.

-----

For now, all it does is connect to y-cruncher. It doesn't actually do anything yet.
